## To-Do List

**https://todolist-app-wc.netlify.app/**

### This is a simple, interactive To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, delete, and update tasks, while also storing their tasks locally in the browser for persistence across sessions. Additionally, users can toggle between light and dark modes, and the current date and time are displayed in the header.

## **Features**
`Add Tasks`: Users can add new tasks to the list.

`Delete Tasks`: Users can remove tasks from the list.

`Update Tasks`: Tasks can be edited directly in the list.

`Theme Toggle`: Switch between light and dark themes.

`Date Display`: Shows the current date and time in the header.

`Local Storage`: All tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist even when the page is reloaded.

`Auto-resizing Textarea`: The task input grows as the user types.

## **Usage**
`Adding Tasks`: Click on the "plus" button in the navbar to add a new task.

`Deleting Tasks`: Click the "X" button next to a task to delete it.

`Editing Tasks`:Click on a task to edit it directly in the text area.

`Toggling Themes`: Click on the theme icon in the navbar to switch between light and dark mode.

`Viewing the Date`: The current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page.

## **Technologies Used**
`React`: For building the user interface.

`UUID`: For generating unique IDs for each task.

`LocalStorage`: For storing tasks across sessions.

`SCSS`: For styling the components.
