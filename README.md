## To-Do List App

**https://todolist-app-wc.netlify.app/**

### This is a simple, interactive To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, delete, and update tasks, while also storing their tasks locally in the browser for persistence across sessions. Additionally, users can toggle between light and dark modes, and the current date and time are displayed in the header. ###

## Features ##
`Add Tasks`: Users can add new tasks to the list.
`Delete Tasks`: Users can remove tasks from the list.
`Update Tasks`: Tasks can be edited directly in the list.
`Theme Toggle`: Switch between light and dark themes.
`Date Display`: Shows the current date and time in the header.
`Local Storage`: All tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist even when the page is reloaded.
`Auto-resizing Textarea`: The task input grows as the user types.
